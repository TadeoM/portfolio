                <h2>What Is This Tadeo?</h2>
                <p>HIT 'EM is a game that plays like pong, with a twist.
                  For those of you unfamiliar with Pong, we'll elaborate on this.
                   This is a "sports" game at heart, "sports" is in "" because
                   this is a very minimalist game. You play as a paddle,
                   this paddle move up and down your side of the screen,
                   the goal is to hit balls off the other player's side
                    of the screen. BUT, you first must get through obstacles
                    that take multiple hits to destroy, otherwise it will be
                    very difficult to score. Also did I mention that the longer
                    you play without scoring, the more balls that will spawn?</p>

                <h2>Will it be Pretty?</h2>
                <p>This will be beautiful...ly simplistic, it will be a
                  very simplistic art style.</p>

                <h2>What's the Story?</h2>
                <p>You are a tennis player who has gone into a drug induced rage.
                  You are halucinating and are out on a rampage to beat every single
                  other tennis player in a game to the death. Because why not.

                <h2>Where Can I Play It?</h2>
                <p>This game is currently only planned to be able to be
                  played on PC, however it will possibly get a mobile version
                  as well. I'll have to see how far I get.</p>
              </section>

              <section class="green">
                <h2>But Tadeo, How do I play?</h2>
                <p>You can play with WASD and arrow keys, obviously however,
                  you wont be using the left and right that much. The game is
                  simple and intuitive enough that there will be no need for a
                  tutorial, however will be awesome enough to play!</p>
